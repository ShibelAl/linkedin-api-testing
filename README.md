# LinkedIn API Testing Project

## Overview

This project is designed to test various LinkedIn API endpoints using Python, unittest, and the Page Object Model (POM) structure. The project consists of four main components: infrastructure (infra), business logic (logic), tests (test), and a configuration file (config.json). There are 10 different tests focusing on GET and POST requests, with each test documented in a Word file.

**API Source:** The LinkedIn APIs used in this project were sourced from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/rockapis-rockapis-default/api/linkedin-api8).

## Components

1. **infra**: Contains infrastructure-related code, such as API wrappers and request handlers.
2. **logic**: Contains business logic for interacting with different LinkedIn API endpoints.
3. **test**: Contains test cases that validate the functionality of the LinkedIn API endpoints.
4. **config.json**: Configuration file containing API keys, endpoints, and other necessary configurations.
5. **docs**: Contains Word documents with detailed test cases for each test in Python.
