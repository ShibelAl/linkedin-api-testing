# LinkedIn API Testing Project

# Overview

This project is designed to test various LinkedIn API endpoints using Python, unittest, and the Page Object Model (POM) structure. The project consists of four main components: infrastructure (infra), business logic (logic), tests (test), and a configuration file (config.json). There are 10 different tests focusing on GET and POST requests, with each test documented in a Word file.

# Components
1. infra/: Contains infrastructure-related code, such as API wrappers and request handlers.
2. logic/: Contains business logic for interacting with different LinkedIn API endpoints.
3. test/: Contains test cases that validate the functionality of the LinkedIn API endpoints.
4. config.json: Configuration file containing API keys, endpoints, and other necessary configurations.
5. docs/: Contains Word documents with detailed test cases for each test in Python.
